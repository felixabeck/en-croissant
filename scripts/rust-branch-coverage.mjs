/**
 * The failure matrix for this artefact (push-review-policy.md section 2).
 *
 * The enumeration follows the throw sites and the filesystem/configuration operations in this
 * file, including the operations awaited by runBranchCoverage. Every row below is staged in
 * scripts/coverage-report-tests.mjs against scratch inputs and fake command results, except the
 * one explicitly marked argued CLI class. A direct exported-function call is a real caller.
 * recordBranchRejection records the message AND rejected-promise status of its async call;
 * recordBranchThrow records the message AND synchronous-throw status of its helper call.
 *
 *  #  site                         distinguishing message                         observed status
 * --- ---------------------------- ---------------------------------------------- ------------------
 *  1  run / spawn failure           spawn <rustup|cargo|merge> ENOENT               rejected promise
 *  2  run / killed command          <command> died with SIGTERM: <command> <argv>  rejected promise
 *  3  run / nonzero status          <command> exited with status 23                rejected promise
 *     Rows 1-3 each stage tool resolution, Cargo, and profile merge separately.

 * 10  assert / descendant readdir   same descendant ENOENT, on the second walk     rejected promise
 * 11  assert / survivor refusal     Rust coverage left stale raw profiles: <path>  rejected promise
 *     Row 11 calls only runBranchCoverage, returns [] then [<absolute path>] from listProfiles,
 *     and proves Cargo never starts. Both walk errors and the removal error also prove that.
 * 12  post-Cargo profile walk       ENOTDIR: not a directory, scandir '<path>'      rejected promise
 * 13  no new profiles               Rust coverage produced no raw profiles         rejected promise

 * 22  exportLcovOrDiagnose / crash   llvm-cov segfaulted while exporting these       synchronous throw
 *                                  sources: ... src-tauri/src/db/schema.rs

 *                                  LCOV
 * 25  export / unisolated signal    llvm-cov died with SIGSEGV while exporting LCOV synchronous throw
 * 26  empty export                  Rust branch coverage export was empty          rejected promise
 * 27  output / writeFile            ENOENT: ... open '<root>/absent/lcov.info'      rejected promise
 * 28  missing branch records        Rust coverage export contains no branch data   rejected promise
 * 29  CLI tool-resolution spawn     spawnSync rustup ENOENT                        exit 1
 *     Row 29 plants one exclusively-created profile in the real coverage target, records the
 *     unchanged profile path set after the spawn, and removes only that file in finally. The
 *     normal green test run verifies restoration; the target directory itself is preserved.
 *
 * CLI spawns past tool resolution are argued, not staged: the entrypoint binds the live coverage
 * target and would remove live profiles or start Cargo. Each rejection above, including the new
 * survivor refusal, escapes main's top-level await as Node's uncaught rejection, whose CLI exit
 * is 1. That exit is described from the exported call, not claimed as a second measured spawn.
 * The staged helper calls do not claim to exercise real Cargo/LLVM failures or a second writer
 * that creates a profile after the refusal walk. No lock is added for that existing race.
