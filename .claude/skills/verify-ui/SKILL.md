# Verify UI (En Croissant)

This file is the source of truth. Codex follows
`.agents/skills/verify-ui/SKILL.md` after reading this contract.

TypeScript + vitest catch code correctness, not layout. Chrome MCP cannot
attach to the Tauri webview and never will: the window is WebKitGTK, which
speaks no Chrome DevTools Protocol. That is an engine difference, not a
configuration gap.

**It does not follow that only Felix can check the real product.** Until
2026-08-30 this file said "there is no documented remote-devtools path", and
that was wrong — Tauri documents WebDriver testing, and on Linux it drives the
real window through `WebKitWebDriver`. Nobody had tried it. `pnpm verify:app`
now does (proof 2 below).

## What counts as proof

1. **Automated visual matrix:** `pnpm test:e2e:container`. Playwright
   builds the renderer, serves preview on `http://127.0.0.1:4173`, and
   mocks native commands. That is the committed screenshot suite. Do not
   invent a second login or Tauri-mock driver.

   **Run it in the container, not natively.** `pnpm test:e2e` runs the same
   specs on the host, and the committed screenshots match what
   `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v<version>-noble` renders - measured
   2026-08-29, 8/8 green in the image with no snapshot rewritten. Natively on
   `tuxedo-atlas` the same specs fail on text rasterization alone - 47-680
   pixels differing along glyph edges, every box and control aligned to the
   pixel. That is not a layout regression and re-recording is not the fix;
   see `tasks/decisions.md`, `d-20260829-01`. `scripts/run-e2e-container.mjs`
   derives the image tag from the installed `@playwright/test` version, runs
   as the invoking user so nothing lands root-owned, and needs docker.

   Snapshots are re-recorded with `pnpm test:e2e:update`, which runs inside
   the same image — there is deliberately no script that re-records them on
   the host, and a direct `playwright ... --update-snapshots` is denied in the
   project settings, because host-rendered images would overwrite the
   canonical ones.
2. **The real application, driven:** `pnpm verify:app`. It starts an
   off-screen compositor (`kwin_wayland --virtual`), then `tauri-driver` ->
   `WebKitWebDriver` -> the release binary, and drives the actual product: real
   Rust backend, real IPC, real WebKitGTK. It runs the app under a throwaway
   `HOME`, because `tauri-plugin-window-state` persists geometry on exit and a
   headless run must not resize the window Felix uses. `scripts/app-driver.mjs`
   is the harness; the WebDriver wire protocol is JSON over HTTP, so it needs no
   npm dependency. `--screenshot <path>` writes a PNG of the page.

   **What it reaches:** anything in the page, plus process-level facts — that
   the app starts, answers script, exits through its own close control, and
   leaves no child behind.

   **What it cannot reach, permanently:** native GTK chrome. The menu bar, the
   window decorations and every file dialog are drawn by GTK, not by the page,
   and WebDriver only sees the page. `issue_engine_binary`
   (`src-tauri/src/main.rs`) always opens a native picker and takes no path
   argument, so **no engine can be registered from here** — any check that needs
   a live engine child is still Felix's.

   Prerequisites, both one-off and named in the failure message if missing:
   `sudo apt install webkit2gtk-driver` (must match the installed
   `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0`) and `cargo install tauri-driver --locked`. It needs
   `pnpm build` first, because it drives the release binary. Not a push gate:
   CI has no compositor and it wants a release build.
3. **Live product window:** `pnpm dev` opens the Tauri webview. This is still
   Felix's check, and still the only route for native menus, native dialogs and
   window chrome. Do not report the Tauri window as browser-verified.
4. **Invalid evidence:** `pnpm start-vite` on `http://localhost:1420`
   plus any Chrome MCP. Vite-only has no Tauri backend. `TopBar.tsx` calls
   `getCurrentWebviewWindow()` at module scope and crashes with
   `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'metadata')`. A blank
   page is not a layout check.

There is no authenticated local page. Do not invent a login driver. This
repo has no `scripts/dev-up.sh`.

## After a visible UI change

5. Run `pnpm test:e2e:container` (add `-- --project=<name>` for a single
   affected project). Keep the snapshots. Missing snapshots are not
   evidence that layout is correct.
6. For responsive work, the committed matrix already includes 320px and
   200% font-scale. That layout is a known open defect (clipped headings,
   `f-20260829-02` in `tasks/findings.md`); a screenshot that records the
   clip is not evidence that it is fixed.
7. If the behaviour only exists in the real product — lifecycle, IPC, process
   teardown, anything the mocked container suite cannot answer — run
   `pnpm verify:app` and report what it asserted.
8. Only if the change can be judged nowhere but in native GTK chrome (menus,
   dialogs, decorations), start `pnpm dev` and name the window check as
   Felix's, not the agent's. That set is now much smaller than it was.

## Report

Name the commands and results, which snapshots moved, and whether a native GTK
check is still needed. Do not claim Chrome MCP verified the app, and do not
claim `pnpm verify:app` verified a menu, a dialog or a window decoration.
