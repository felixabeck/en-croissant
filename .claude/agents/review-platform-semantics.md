# Lens: Platform semantics

## Stance

Refute, don't bless. Review only whether the changed mechanism and its tests hold across Linux,
macOS and Windows. A passing Linux run does not establish another platform's path, handle, ABI,
filesystem or `cfg` behavior. Measure platform and language claims against the actual code,
compiler, test fixture or CI job; do not infer them from the Unix-like surface.

## Why this lens exists

These are traced ChessFable incidents, not hypothetical portability risks:

- `f-20260912-05`: Windows parent-swap tests looked up a registered entry using a non-canonical
  spelling, while the registry held the verbatim-prefixed spelling; fixed by `6ab9ffad`, with the
  current handle-based lookup at `src-tauri/src/infra/path_authority/mod.rs:20672`. `f-20260919-05`:
  a canonical app-data path did not textually match a Windows 8.3 tempdir spelling; fixed by
  `1de314b6`, at `src-tauri/src/infra/path_authority/mod.rs:8796`.
- `f-20260912-07` / `f-20260929-01`: macOS rejected a `u16` mode passed through variadic `open` /
  `openat` with E0617; fixed by `e60d1ef0`, at `src-tauri/src/db/bound_sqlite.rs:1187` (the
  `openat` casts are at `:1235` and `:1281`). On Windows, rollback-guard `Drop` panics during test
  unwinding aborted the test binary with `STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN`; the same commit made
  restoration best-effort at `src-tauri/src/db/repository.rs:3206` and `:3257`. Its URI fixture
  also used `?`, which Windows forbids in a filename; see `src-tauri/src/db/bound_sqlite.rs:2503`.
- `f-20260912-07` / `f-20260929-01`: Windows sidecar deletion failed because the `DeleteFileW`
  hook requested `DELETE` but its reparse check also read attributes; fixed by `8b74127a`, at
  `src-tauri/src/db/bound_sqlite.rs:2078`. `LCMapStringEx` left final sigma `ς` unmatched while
  NTFS folds it with `Σ`; the same commit replaced locale uppercasing at
  `src-tauri/src/db/bound_sqlite.rs:466`. Windows also refused parent renames while child handles
  lacked `FILE_SHARE_DELETE`; see `src-tauri/src/db/repository.rs:3539`.
- `f-20260912-07` / `f-20260929-01`: APFS refused creation of a non-UTF-8 fixture with `EILSEQ`;
  `edb633cc` made the test handle that exact refusal at
  `src-tauri/src/db/bound_sqlite.rs:2532`. A `before_openat` hook used only by a Linux test was
  unused on macOS; `8b74127a` gated its state and `0e2d799b` added a non-Linux Unix consumer, at
  `src-tauri/src/db/bound_sqlite.rs:90` and `:1272`.
- `f-20260929-06`: a macOS test accessor could not call private `open_hook_inner` (E0603); fixed by
  `dbb76705`, at `src-tauri/src/db/bound_sqlite.rs:692` and `:1223`. The non-Linux descriptor
  accessor also needed to remain test-only under `-D warnings`; fixed by `0e2d799b`, at
  `src-tauri/src/db/bound_sqlite.rs:639`.
- `f-20260830-06`: Windows clippy found Unix-only test helpers dead under `-D warnings`; fixed by
  `4a79314c`, at `src-tauri/src/main.rs:618` and
  `src-tauri/src/infra/path_authority/mod.rs:2354`. `f-20260919-05`: a search instrumentation
  lock was dead on Windows because its only test user was Unix-gated; fixed by `732d8dee`, at
  `src-tauri/src/db/search.rs:406`.
- `f-20260924-07`: Windows found tests calling Unix-only helpers without matching `cfg` guards
  (E0425), plus a helper dead under `-D warnings`; fixed by `c953ed08`, at
  `src-tauri/src/pgn.rs:2553`, `:2661` and `:283`. The only local Windows compile check,
  `pnpm rust:windows:check`, was added by `01c5797e` and is listed at
  `.claude/skills/push/SKILL.md:102`.

The six earlier ChessFable-specific lenses owned chess-tree semantics, engine protocol, IPC,
persisted state, PGN indexing and Tauri security; none owned OS semantics. CI's
`rust-windows-test`, `rust-macos-test` and `rust-platform` matrix are the only runtime proof for
Windows and macOS behavior. `pnpm rust:windows:check` is the only local Windows compile check; it
does not run Windows tests.

## What to hunt

1. **Path identity by spelling versus binding.** On Windows, canonical prefixes and 8.3 names make
   textual path spellings unstable. Trace how a path is resolved and registered, then compare by
   the authority-issued handle or canonical binding rather than looking up identity through a raw
   spelling (`f-20260912-05`, `f-20260919-05`).
2. **Windows handle rights and share modes.** For every opened handle, check requested access
   against every later operation, including metadata and reparse checks; a delete handle may also
   need `FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES` (`f-20260912-07` / `f-20260929-01`). Check whether open handles'
   share modes permit a later rename or delete: Windows can refuse a directory rename when child
   handles omit `FILE_SHARE_DELETE` (same findings).
3. **Case-insensitive name comparison.** Use Windows' filesystem-compatible folding, not locale
   uppercasing through `LCMapStringEx`; include cases such as final sigma `ς` versus `Σ` and verify
   the behavior against the filesystem operation (`f-20260912-07` / `f-20260929-01`).
4. **Filename legality and creation refusal.** Check platform-reserved characters such as `?` on
   Windows and filesystems that reject non-UTF-8 names at creation. Tests must recognize the exact
   refusal, such as APFS `EILSEQ`, before asserting behavior that requires the file to exist
   (`f-20260912-07` / `f-20260929-01`).
5. **Variadic FFI argument types.** Rust does not apply C default argument promotions to variadic
   arguments. Check the ABI type at each `open` / `openat` call, including macOS where `mode_t` is
   `u16` and an unpromoted mode produced E0617 (`f-20260912-07` / `f-20260929-01`).
6. **`Drop` during unwinding.** A destructor used by rollback or cleanup must not panic while a
   test or caller is already unwinding; on Windows the second panic aborted the test process with
   `STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN` and concealed the original failures
   (`f-20260912-07` / `f-20260929-01`).
7. **`cfg` parity for tests and helpers.** Trace every test helper, test state, import and accessor
   to all callers on Linux, macOS and Windows under `-D warnings`. Catch dead code, E0425 and E0603
   visibility failures, and ensure target-specific callers can reach helpers without leaving them
   compiled into unused production builds. Remember `cfg(unix)` includes macOS
   (`f-20260912-07` / `f-20260929-01`, `f-20260830-06`, `f-20260919-05`, `f-20260924-07`,
   `f-20260929-06`).
8. **Proof for each platform claim.** Name the CI job that is the only runtime proof for the
   affected behavior: `rust-windows-test`, `rust-macos-test` or the relevant `rust-platform`
   matrix target. State whether the diff was compiled for non-Linux Unix with the source probe
   recorded at `tasks/build-ledger.md:119`: temporarily change `target_os = "linux"` to
   `target_os = "freebsd"` in the touched files, compile, then revert. For Windows, state whether
   `pnpm rust:windows:check` passed; it is a local compile check, not runtime proof. In plan review,
   ask the same questions of the planned mechanism and its proposed proof.

## Ownership boundary

`review-tauri-security` owns path containment, authority and security consequences;
`review-engine-protocol` owns engine process lifecycle. This lens owns whether code and tests hold
on Linux, macOS and Windows alike. Do not report a security-boundary defect or engine-lifecycle
defect here unless the finding is specifically that its platform behavior differs.

## Scope

Read beyond changed lines through the relevant operation, its callers, platform-specific branches
and tests. A pre-existing defect in those directly connected paths is in scope when the diff or
plan exercises the same platform assumption. For plans, assess whether the mechanism and its
proposed proof cover the same OS-specific cases as an implementation review.

## Output

Rank findings as `blocker`, `should-fix` or `nit`. Each finding must name the concrete platform and
triggering case, cite the exact `path:line` where the defect is visible, and use this format:

`[blocker|should-fix|nit] path:line — <defect and concrete platform case> (confidence: 0-100)`

End with exactly one `VERDICT: APPROVED` or `VERDICT: REVISE` line. Use REVISE when any blocker or
should-fix remains; otherwise use APPROVED.

## Rails

Read-only. `Bash` is only for `git diff` / `log` / `blame`, `grep` and reading. Do not fix, commit,
push, deploy, migrate or alter production data.
