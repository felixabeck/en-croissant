/*!
Phase A through Phase E refusal-pin proof records (2026-09-17).

The refusal sites are pinned by the G and B rows below: 20 of the original 35,
after `f-20260914-08` retired eleven by giving them real Windows bodies (the
four `file_workspace.rs` rows and the seven named under "B rows"). The O4d exclusion is
`opened_file_change_stamp`: its unconditional non-unix tail is not a refusal
site and is intentionally not a row.

Closed-world refusal assertions (f-20260916-01, Phase 2, 2026-10-04):
B pins the whole comment-blanked, compacted subject file, including its helper declarations,
bodies and test-module declaration. C inventories every production platform_support identifier
outside the two exact subject/verifier keys: only the infra module declaration and qualified,
literal-label helper calls are allowed; the call-site multiset must equal the guard and routed
rows. D rejects both refusal stems inside folded literal contents and the whole phrase in each
file's joined literal stream. E blanks only braced inline test-module bodies, retaining production
before and after them, byte offsets and newlines; cfg(not(test)) does not hide production.
The review repair removed the dormant body-row verifier (BodyRow/ExpectedBody/check_source_pin,
`remaining_refusal_body_rows_are_none`): C rejects any re-added refusal site, so a future body-form
refusal site fails C first, which pins its (file, function, helper, label) tuple; pinning its
body (effects, cfg and scope placement) then needs the body-row verifier restored from commit
e3c6b225 (or an equivalent row check), alongside the new row; the test count is therefore 58.
S-new-site, S-outside-fn, S-after-tests, S-cfg-not-test, S-label-const, S-literal, S-concat-2 and
S-format were re-run on the repaired tree with identical messages and exit 101.

S-multiline-cfg — oauth.rs: insert the multi-line attribute below immediately before
`pub async fn authenticate(`. Detached HEAD 5c34fd06 plus this verifier diff compiled;
`refusal_guards_are_first_statements_and_precede_their_effects` failed with every message line:
```text
refusal guard pins failed:
oauth.rs: pub async fn authenticate( carries forbidden #[cfg(any(
    unix,
    target_os = "a-long-platform-name",
    target_os = "another-long-platform-name"
))]
```
Exit status: 101 (63 passed; 1 failed). The same mutation on detached HEAD 5c34fd06
without this diff compiled and stayed green: 58 passed; 0 failed; exit status 0.

Named limits: L1 — differently worded Windows errors; L2 — runtime or procedural-macro wording,
character-escape encoding, or a format! split with neither stem intact and intervening arguments
in source order; L3 — plain literals spanning an unescaped physical newline (the shared lexer
stops there); L4 — the verifier's own cfg gate can compile every assertion out. The existing
Linux/Windows test-line comparison observes L4. These limits continue R6-06; no assertion of
B, C or D is argued.

Phase 2 staged failure matrix. Each run below used a detached disposable worktree of the final
phase tree and the filter infra::platform_support::tests. Only production inputs were mutated;
neither this verifier nor blocking.rs was edited during a staged run. The tree was restored
between cases. BASE controls used efc52a4db3eed36d2bc0cdeb7616e0694b6abb8e. Every mutation compiled;
each assertion failure exited 101. Both worktrees were removed afterwards.

- C unqualified reference: S-alias, S-module-import, S-reexport, S-second-subject-name.
- C nonliteral label: S-label-const.
- C outside a named function: S-outside-fn.
- C unexpected multiset members: S-new-site, S-duplicate, S-after-tests, S-cfg-not-test.
- C missing multiset members: S-alias, S-label-const, S-removed.

- D joined phrase: S-literal, S-concat-1/2/3, S-case-continuation, S-second-subject-name.

S-format stages D-stem alone; S-concat-2 stages D-joined alone. All nine message paths are
staged, none argued. E's after-tests gap and D's old filename exemption each have a green BASE
control. Older records below are retained as historical evidence.

Phase A G rows (each staged message names the listed file and signature):
`infra/path_authority/mod.rs::ensure_app_owned_default_dir`,
`fs.rs::download_engine_archive`,
`oauth.rs::authenticate`, `oauth.rs::migrate_legacy_lichess_token`,
`infra/path_authority/mod.rs::engine_resource`,
`fs.rs::set_file_as_executable_blocking` (retired 2026-09-20 with the command
itself, `f-20260906-08`; the guard moved to
`infra/path_authority/mod.rs::register_installed_engine`, which is where the
executable mark now happens),
`puzzle.rs::delete_puzzle_database`, `puzzle.rs::get_puzzle`.

Phase A B rows (each staged message names the listed file and signature).
`file_workspace.rs`'s four rows — `mutation_target`, `register_created_entry`,
`collect_tree_entries` and `paired_rename` — were retired when `f-20260914-08`
ported them; `workspace_bodies_are_single_ungated_delegations` replaced them,
because a deleted row can no longer notice its refusal coming back. The same
port removed seven further rows whose counterparts no longer exist at all —
`infra/fs.rs::{entry_identity_at, create_dir_at, open_directory_at,
rename_entry_at, remove_entry_at, remove_optional_regular_at}` and
`infra/path_authority/mod.rs::entries`, all of which now have real Windows
bodies. The rows that remain are:
`infra/fs.rs::atomic_install_dir`,
`infra/path_authority/mod.rs::remove_leaf_identified`,
`infra/path_authority/mod.rs::open_regular_relative`,
`infra/path_authority/mod.rs::authorize_existing_dir`,
`infra/path_authority/resolved.rs::atomic_install_download_dir`,
`infra/path_authority/resolved.rs::puzzle_database_target`,
`infra/path_authority/resolved.rs::delete_puzzle_database`,
`infra/path_authority/resolved.rs::mark_engine_executable`,
`db/mod.rs::unlink_database_files`, `db/repository.rs::identity_from_probe`.

Phase A removes four B rows — `open_current`, `capability_directory`,
`create_database_child` and `database_file_target` — leaving **11 body rows
and 9 guard rows**, counted from `body_rows()` and `guard_rows()` below. The
guard rows are unchanged; the counts are recorded at this phase boundary
rather than copied from the plan's final arithmetic.

Phase B removes the two puzzle rows — `puzzle_database_target` and
`delete_puzzle_database` — and the two puzzle guard rows, leaving **9 body rows
and 7 guard rows**, counted from the arrays below. The positive row-absence
assertion and its staged break are recorded below.

Phase C removes the `unlink_database_files` and `identity_from_probe` rows,
leaving **7 body rows and 7 guard rows**, counted from the arrays below. The
positive row-absence assertion and its staged break are recorded below.

Phase D removes the `open_valid_preferred` row, leaving **6 body rows and 7
guard rows**, counted from the arrays below. The positive row-absence assertion
and its staged break are recorded below.

Phase E removes the `ensure_app_owned_default_dir` guard row and the
`remove_leaf_identified`, `open_regular_relative` and `authorize_existing_dir`
body rows, leaving **3 body rows and 6 guard rows**, counted from the arrays
below. Those four retired functions are held to one ungated definition each by
`phase_e_removed_rows_have_one_ungated_definition_without_refusals`, which is
also the Linux-red pin against re-inserting the `ensure_app_owned_default_dir`
guard.

Phase 1 of the Windows engine-directory slice (`f-20260914-12`, d-20260918-08)
removes the `engine_resource` guard row: the Windows Directory arm now consumes
`take_directory()` plus the `target` the no-follow walk already computed, so a
directory resource resolves to a lease whose `uci_value` is that retained path.
That leaves **3 body rows and 5 guard rows**, counted from the arrays below.
`engine_resource` keeps `#[cfg(windows)]` arms, so it is pinned by the
Directory-arm source assertion
(`engine_resource_directory_arm_takes_a_directory_and_target_without_refusals`)
rather than by `assert_removed_rows_are_ungated`.

Phase 2 of that slice (d-20260918-09) makes Windows executable mode a checked
no-op: the `#[cfg(not(unix))]` counterpart keeps the EngineInstall and
file-present checks and returns `Ok(())`, so its refusal body row is deleted and
the `set_file_as_executable_blocking` guard row and its `"engine executable
mode"` routed label go with it. That leaves **2 body rows and 4 guard rows**,
counted from the arrays below, and the Ok counterpart is pinned by
`mark_engine_executable_windows_is_a_checked_noop` rather than by a refusal row.

On 2026-09-20 (`f-20260906-08`) `set_file_as_executable` itself was deleted: it
had had no renderer caller since `3afed031`, and the executable mark moved into
`infra/path_authority/mod.rs::register_installed_engine`, which already resolves
the target under `EngineInstall`. Its test guard moved with it and is now
`register_installed_engine_marks_executable_without_off_unix_refusal`, which
additionally pins `?`-propagation, mark-before-persist ordering, and the absence
of the deleted command from `fs.rs` and `main.rs`. No row count changes: the
guard row had already gone in the paragraph above.

Phase 3 of that slice (`f-20260909-01`, d-20260918-10, d-20260918-11) ports the
last two refusal bodies: `infra/fs.rs::atomic_install_dir` now dispatches to the
shared `install_dir_driver` on both platforms and
`infra/path_authority/resolved.rs::atomic_install_download_dir` delegates to it
on both, so both body rows are deleted. The `fs.rs::download_engine_archive`
guard row and its `"engine archive downloads"` routed refusal go with them,
because production staging moved beside the destination
(`private_tempdir_in`) and the command no longer refuses off unix. That leaves
**0 body rows and 3 guard rows**, counted from the arrays below; with the body
list empty the per-row counterpart loop is replaced by
`remaining_refusal_body_rows_are_none`, and the last `refusal_text_has_one_source`
carve-out (`"atomic directory installation is "`) is deleted.

The `f-20260914-15` command-entry phase (d-20260918-13) adds a first-statement
`off_unix_refusal("PGN atomic replacement", cfg!(unix))?;` to `delete_game`, `write_game`
and `export_to_pgn`: each reached the refusing `replace_pgn_atomic` helper only after
`operations.accept`, path-authority resolution, PGN scan or database open. The helper guard
itself stays as the last line of defence for the cores. That leaves **0 body rows and 6
guard rows**, counted from the arrays below. Completeness is the helper call graph, pinned
by `production_replace_pgn_atomic_calls_are_only_edit_existing_and_export_to_pgn_blocking`
and `production_calls_of_every_pgn_atomic_path_node_are_only_from_allowed_callers`, whose
staged breaks are recorded in the matrix below.

Staged failure matrix. Every run used a detached disposable worktree copied
from this phase, mutated production files only, and ran the named
`platform_support` test or filter with
`cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`.
The worktree was removed afterwards. “G all” means every G row above; “B all”
means every B row above, so the named row messages are recorded without
repeating the 35 names six times.

1. S-insert — inserted
   `std::fs::create_dir_all("staged").ok();` as the first effective B
   statement and immediately before every G guard. Failing tests:
   `refusal_guards_are_first_statements_and_precede_their_effects` and
   `non_unix_counterparts_have_only_typed_refusal_bodies`. Messages observed:
   Every G row except `infra/path_authority/mod.rs::engine_resource` reported
   `guard is not first statement`; that engine row reported `directory guard
   block changed`. B all reported `effective non-unix body changed`. Exit
   status: 101.
2. S-variant — changed every effective-path refusal to
   `Error::InvalidInput(` while preserving its message text (including the
   inline Conflict refusals and routed refusal calls). Failing tests:
   `refusal_constant_and_callees_are_exact`,
   `refusal_guards_are_first_statements_and_precede_their_effects`,
   `routed_refusal_labels_are_unchanged`, and
   `non_unix_counterparts_have_only_typed_refusal_bodies`. Messages observed:
   the constant row named `UNSUPPORTED_DIRECTORY_ENUMERATION`; G all named
   `guard changed`; routed rows named their changed labels/counts; B all named
   `effective non-unix body changed`. Exit status: 101.
3. S-message — appended one `x` to every effective-path G operation label, B
   refusal label/literal, and the `UNSUPPORTED_DIRECTORY_ENUMERATION` literal.
   Failing tests:
   `refusal_constant_and_callees_are_exact`,
   `refusal_guards_are_first_statements_and_precede_their_effects`,
   `routed_refusal_labels_are_unchanged`, and
   `non_unix_counterparts_have_only_typed_refusal_bodies`. Messages observed:
   the constant row named `UNSUPPORTED_DIRECTORY_ENUMERATION`; G all named
   `guard changed`; routed rows named their changed labels/counts; B all named
   `effective non-unix body changed`. Exit status: 101.
4. S-cfg — changed counterpart/non-unix refusal cfgs to `#[cfg(windows)]`,
   wrapped B refusal statements in `#[cfg(unix)]`, flattened Block refusal
   attrs/braces while making unix arms return, changed every G `cfg!(unix)` to
   `cfg!(windows)`, added `#[cfg(unix)]` to every G function, and added it to
   the `PathAuthority` impl containing `capability_directory` and `mod
   resolved;`. Failing tests:
   `refusal_constant_and_callees_are_exact`,
   `refusal_guards_are_first_statements_and_precede_their_effects`, and
   `non_unix_counterparts_have_only_typed_refusal_bodies`. Messages observed:

   their forbidden cfg, enclosing scope where applicable, and changed guard;
   B all named their form/body change, forbidden cfg, enclosing scope or
   module declaration where applicable. Exit status: 101.
5. S-constant — changed the literal
   `fd-relative directory enumeration` to
   `fd-relative directory enumerationx` in
   `UNSUPPORTED_DIRECTORY_ENUMERATION`. Failing test:
   `refusal_constant_and_callees_are_exact`. Message observed:
   `infra/path_authority/mod.rs: UNSUPPORTED_DIRECTORY_ENUMERATION declaration
   changed`. Exit status: 101.
6. S-callee — inserted
   `std::fs::create_dir_all("staged").ok();` as the first statement of both
   `single_leaf` and `validate_components`. Failing test:
   `refusal_constant_and_callees_are_exact`. Messages observed:
   `infra/fs.rs: pub(crate) fn single_leaf(: body changed` and
   `infra/path_authority/mod.rs: fn validate_components(: body changed` — each
   naming the file the pinned body actually lives in, which is what
   `check_helper`'s `file` parameter exists for. Both rows were reported in the
   same run, which is the observation behind the row-collecting requirement: a
   fail-fast loop would have hidden the second. Exit status: 101.
7. S-component — changed the reserved-device predicate arm for `COM1` to
   `COM1_STAGED`. Failing test:
   `windows_component_gate_covers_namespace_shapes_and_both_gates`. Message
   observed: `Windows component gate checks failed: COM1.db3, COM1, device
   extension`. Exit status: 101.
8. S-parent-access — changed the first `db/search_index.rs` parent access from
   `Readable` to `Writable`. Failing test:
   `phase_a_parent_access_predicate_and_call_sites_are_explicit`. Message
   observed: `parent access pins failed: search-index access call sites`.
   Exit status: 101.
9. S-database-leaf — removed the `validate_windows_database_leaf(filename)?;`
   call from `create_database_child`, replacing it with a no-op validation in
   the disposable copy. Failing test:
   `database_leaf_bound_is_checked_at_creation_and_registration`. Message
   observed: `database leaf bound must guard both entry points and both derived
   sidecars` (the diagnostic included the changed create body). Exit status:
   101.
10. S-unicode-length — changed the `open_windows_child` call to pass
    `wide.len().saturating_sub(1)` to the checked helper. Failing test:
    `unicode_string_length_guard_is_checked_and_called`. Message observed:
    `UNICODE_STRING length guard is missing or not used` (the diagnostic
    included the changed opener body). Exit status: 101.
11. S-row-absence — inserted a Windows-only staged refusal into
    `capability_directory`. Failing test:
    `phase_a_removed_rows_have_one_ungated_definition_without_refusals`.
    Message observed: `Phase A refusal rows or definitions are wrong: 11 body
    rows, 9 guard rows, ["infra/path_authority/mod.rs: pub(crate) fn
    capability_directory("]`. Exit status: 101.
12. S-phase-b-row-absence — inserted
    `let _staged = crate::infra::platform_support::unsupported("puzzle database targets");`
    as the first statement of `puzzle_database_target` in the disposable copy.
    Failing test: `phase_b_removed_rows_have_one_ungated_definition_without_refusals`.
    Message observed: `Phase B refusal rows or definitions are wrong: 9 body
    rows, 7 guard rows, ["infra/path_authority/resolved.rs: pub(crate) fn
    puzzle_database_target("]`. Exit status: 101.
13. S-phase-c-row-absence — inserted
    `let _staged = crate::infra::platform_support::unsupported("database identity probing");`
    as the first statement of `identity_from_probe` in the disposable copy.
    Failing test: `phase_c_removed_rows_have_one_ungated_definition_without_refusals`.
    Message observed: `Phase C refusal rows or definitions are wrong: 7 body
    rows, 7 guard rows, ["db/repository.rs: pub(crate) fn identity_from_probe("]`.
    Exit status: 101. The same assertion collects the database-deletion row if
    the staged refusal is inserted into `unlink_database_files` instead.
14. S-phase-d-row-absence — inserted
    `let _staged = crate::infra::platform_support::unsupported("fd-relative search index loading");`
    as the first statement of `open_valid_preferred` in the disposable copy.
    Failing test:
    `phase_d_removed_rows_have_one_ungated_definition_without_refusals`.
    Message observed: `Phase D refusal rows or definitions are wrong: 6 body
    rows, 7 guard rows, ["db/search.rs: fn open_valid_preferred("]`. Exit
    status: 101.
15. S-phase-d-classifier-raw — changed the Windows reparse raw-code arm from
    `ProbeErrorClass::Reparse` to `WrongKind` in the disposable classifier.
    Failing assertion: `raw code 1920`; observed message:
    `assertion left == right failed: raw code 1920; left: WrongKind; right:
    Reparse`. Exit status: 101.
16. S-phase-d-classifier-reparse-message — changed the exact reparse
    `InvalidInput` arm to `WrongKind`. Failing assertion:
    `InvalidInput reparse message must classify as Reparse`; observed message:
    `left: WrongKind; right: Reparse`. Exit status: 101.
17. S-phase-d-classifier-wrong-kind-message — changed the exact regular-file
    `InvalidInput` arm to `Other`. Failing assertion:
    `InvalidInput regular-file message must classify as WrongKind`; observed
    message: `left: Other; right: WrongKind`. Exit status: 101.
18. S-phase-d-classifier-malformed — changed the `InvalidData` arm to `Other`.
    Failing assertion: `InvalidData must classify as Malformed`; observed
    message: `left: Other; right: Malformed`. Exit status: 101.
19. S-phase-d-classifier-directory — changed the ambiguous-directory return to
    `Other`. Failing assertion: `ambiguous directory failure must classify as
    WrongKind`; observed message: `left: Other; right: WrongKind`. Exit status:
    101.
20. S-phase-d-classifier-permission — changed the classifier fallback to
    `WrongKind`. Failing assertion: `permission failure must remain Other`;
    observed message: `left: WrongKind; right: Other`. Exit status: 101.
21. S-phase-d-open-current-row — reordered the `open_current` class arm in the
    disposable source. Failing assertion: `open_current must map Reparse with
    absence and wrong-kind to Conflict`. Exit status: 101.
22. S-phase-d-loader-row — reordered the loader's NotFound/Reparse arm.
    Failing assertion: `loader must swallow NotFound and Reparse`. Exit status:

    WrongKind arm. Failing assertion: `promotion must map preferred Reparse,
    WrongKind and Malformed to Ok(false)`. Exit status: 101.
24. S-phase-d-deletion-row — reordered the deletion Reparse and WrongKind arm.
    Failing assertion: `deletion must map Reparse and WrongKind to InvalidInput`.
    Exit status: 101.
25. S-sidecar-preferred-race — reverted the preferred-sidecar removal to a
    name-based `remove_optional_regular_at`. Failing test:
    `unlink_database_files_rechecks_preferred_sidecar_identity_and_ignores_vanishing_sidecars`.
    Message observed: "called `Result::unwrap_err()` on an `Ok` value: (2, None)".
    Exit status: 101.
26. S-sidecar-legacy-race — reverted the legacy-sidecar removal to ignore the
    identity returned by `legacy_sidecar_matches`. Failing test:
    `legacy_sidecar_removal_uses_the_verified_identity_and_skips_corrupt_archives`.
    Message observed: "called `Result::unwrap_err()` on an `Ok` value: (2, None)".
    Exit status: 101.
27. S-legacy-mapped-removal — removed `drop(archive)` from
    `promote_legacy_index_sidecar_at`. Failing test:
    `legacy_index_mapping_is_dropped_before_removal`.
    Message observed: "Windows refuses a still-mapped legacy index (ERROR_USER_MAPPED_FILE): drop(archive) must precede remove_entry_at".
    Exit status: 101.
28. S-f15-pin-one — inserted a staged production
    `F15StagedPinOne.replace_pgn_atomic();` above `mod tests` in
    `infra/path_authority/mod.rs`. Failing test:
    `production_replace_pgn_atomic_calls_are_only_edit_existing_and_export_to_pgn_blocking`.
    Message observed: `production replace_pgn_atomic call pin failed:
    infra/path_authority/mod.rs: 1 production .replace_pgn_atomic( call(s) outside
    edit_existing and export_to_pgn_blocking`. Exit status: 101.
29. S-f15-pin-two — added a staged `#[tauri::command]` `f15_staged_pin_two` in `fs.rs`
    whose closure calls `crate::pgn::delete_game_core`. Failing test:
    `production_calls_of_every_pgn_atomic_path_node_are_only_from_allowed_callers`.
    Message observed: `production PGN atomic-path caller pin failed: fs.rs:
    delete_game_core called from f15_staged_pin_two, allowed ["delete_game"]`.
