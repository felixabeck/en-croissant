 * `engineId` carries the immutable application id rather than the path handle, so a result
 * arriving later stays bound to the engine that was actually asked. MultiPV is dropped because
 * a game engine plays one move, and a time control makes `go` the backend's decision.
 *
 * `availableEngines` is the live engine list and is authoritative, both for existence and for
 * the engine's own fields. Removing an engine permanently retires its application id
 * (d-20260901-17), so a selection that survived the removal — or one that cannot be proven live
 * because the list has not hydrated yet (`undefined`) — is rejected here rather than sent to a
 * supervisor that will refuse it.
