# Technical decisions made while working findings

Findings are worked in **fresh sessions**, so a decision that lives only in a run's context is lost
the moment that run ends — and the next session re-derives the question and can land on the other
option. This file is what later sessions read instead. `scripts/findings.py next` prints the entries
governing the cluster it picks.

**A decision here is input, not an open question.** The rules for reversing one, the second-reversal
park, and why the whole mechanism exists are in
`~/.claude/references/findings-ledger-contract.md` ("Decisions bind later sessions"). Not repeated
here. Universal rule 4c applies without exception: a recorded decision is reversed by Felix, in the
chat, and by nothing else, and no session writes `(Felix, <date>)` against something he did not say.

**Technical calls only** — which mechanism, which default, which failure mode is preferable.

### d-20260829-01 — Where does the canonical Playwright rasterization environment live?

* **Governs:** -
* **Chosen:** the pinned container image `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.62.1-noble`, used both
  locally (`pnpm test:e2e:container`) and by the CI e2e step, with the committed snapshots recorded
  inside it.
* **Rejected:** re-recording the snapshots natively on `tuxedo-atlas` and treating that machine as
  the reference (it moves the failure to every other machine, including the CI runner, so the
  visual matrix could never be verified anywhere but atlas); and relaxing the comparison with
  `maxDiffPixelRatio ≈ 0.02` (the observed antialiasing noise is ratio 0.01, so a threshold wide
  enough to absorb it also absorbs a genuinely changed label).
* **Because:** the 8 failing specs differed only along glyph edges — every box, icon and control
  aligned to the pixel — so the defect was the *environment*, not the layout or the tolerance. One
  canonical environment removes the machine from the measurement instead of widening the gate.
* **Measured after deciding, 2026-08-29:** the committed snapshots needed **no** rewrite. All eight
  specs pass unchanged inside the image (`8 passed (18.2s)`), so the images already match what it
  renders and `tuxedo-atlas` running natively is the outlier. Nothing was re-recorded.
  `pnpm test:e2e:update` was repointed at the container runner on the same day, so there is no
  script that re-records on the host at all; a direct `playwright … --update-snapshots` stays
  denied in `.claude/settings.json`.
* **Decided by:** Felix, in the chat, 2026-08-29 · **Superseded-by:** -
