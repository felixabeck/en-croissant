# Technical decisions made while working findings

Findings are worked in **fresh sessions**, so a decision that lives only in a run's context is lost
the moment that run ends — and the next session re-derives the question and can land on the other
option. This file is what later sessions read instead. `scripts/findings.py next` prints the entries
governing the cluster it picks.

**A decision here is input, not an open question.** The rules for reversing one, the second-reversal
park, and why the whole mechanism exists are in
`~/.claude/references/findings-ledger-contract.md` ("Decisions bind later sessions"). Not repeated
here. Universal rule 4c applies without exception: a recorded decision is reversed by Felix, in the
chat, and by nothing else, and no session writes `(Felix, <date>)` against something he did not say.

**Technical calls only** — which mechanism, which default, which failure mode is preferable.

### d-20260829-01 — Where does the canonical Playwright rasterization environment live?

* **Governs:** -
* **Chosen:** the pinned container image `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.62.1-noble`, used both
  locally (`pnpm test:e2e:container`) and by the CI e2e step, with the committed snapshots recorded
  inside it.
* **Rejected:** re-recording the snapshots natively on `tuxedo-atlas` and treating that machine as
  the reference (it moves the failure to every other machine, including the CI runner, so the
  visual matrix could never be verified anywhere but atlas); and relaxing the comparison with
  `maxDiffPixelRatio ≈ 0.02` (the observed antialiasing noise is ratio 0.01, so a threshold wide
  enough to absorb it also absorbs a genuinely changed label).
* **Because:** the 8 failing specs differed only along glyph edges — every box, icon and control
  aligned to the pixel — so the defect was the *environment*, not the layout or the tolerance. One
  canonical environment removes the machine from the measurement instead of widening the gate.
* **Measured after deciding, 2026-08-29:** the committed snapshots needed **no** rewrite. All eight
  specs pass unchanged inside the image (`8 passed (18.2s)`), so the images already match what it
  renders and `tuxedo-atlas` running natively is the outlier. Nothing was re-recorded.
  `pnpm test:e2e:update` was repointed at the container runner on the same day, so there is no
  script that re-records on the host at all; a direct `playwright … --update-snapshots` stays
  denied in `.claude/settings.json`.

### d-20260829-02 — The coverage baselines record a machine nobody uses. Re-record, or keep them?

* **Governs:** f-20260829-06, f-20260829-01, f-20260829-04
* **Chosen:** re-establish both baselines from the canonical environment, in two steps so the
  backend is measured and not assumed — re-record the frontend baseline on atlas (which measures
  identically to CI), push, let CI run through to the backend ratchet, then re-record the backend
  baseline from CI's own LCOV artifact. Every per-area delta is listed in the commit message so a
  later reader can audit each one instead of trusting a rewritten file.
* **Rejected:** keeping the baselines and accepting a permanently red `test.yml` (one stale number
  would keep eleven working gates switched off — `build-vite`, `bindings:check`, `bundle:check`,
  the container e2e, `mutation:frontend` and the whole Rust half never run again); and weakening the
  ratchet to compare covered counts only, which would pass today but would stop catching a change
  that adds untested lines faster than tested ones — the property the ratchet exists for.
* **Because:** CI run 33275934621 measured `tauri-ipc-platform` at 156/218, byte-identical to
  atlas, while the baseline records 155/215. Two independent current environments agree and the
  baseline matches neither, so it describes the laptop the 2026-08-09 audit ran on. Covered lines
  went **up** (156 vs 155) on an unchanged tree; only the counted total rose, so the ratio slipped.
  This is re-recording on a changed instrument, not silencing a regression — which is the case
  `docs/coverage.md` actually forbids.
* **Standing constraint this does NOT relax:** `coverage:baseline:*` stays denied in
  `.claude/settings.json`, and a red ratchet still means "investigate", never "re-record". Lifting
  it requires a recorded decision like this one, naming the evidence that the baseline — not the
  code — is what moved. Do not cite this entry as precedent for a re-baseline that lacks such
  evidence.

### d-20260829-03 — Deleting a covered dead branch trips the ratchet. Refresh, or keep the dead code?

* **Governs:** f-20260829-08, f-20260829-15
* **Chosen:** refresh the baseline for the one metric that moved. Removing the dead
  `queuedGeneration !== null` clause deleted one branch that happened to be covered, so
  `boards-game-analysis` branches went 181/5677 to 180/5676 — numerator and denominator each down
  by exactly one, because the branch no longer exists.
* **Rejected:** restoring the dead clause to keep the number. That would let the gate dictate worse
  code — and the clause is provably unreachable-as-false, which is why mutation testing flagged it.
* **Because:** `docs/coverage.md` forbids refreshing a baseline *to accept a regression*, and treats
  refreshing as ordinary practice otherwise ("new security or IPC surfaces require focused tests
  before the baseline is refreshed"). No behaviour lost coverage here: a branch that could never be
  false stopped existing. The audit is one line wide and in the commit message, so the claim is
  checkable rather than asserted.
* **Note the general problem this exposes:** the ratchet rejects a lower covered count outright, so
  it penalises *deleting* covered code — exactly the cleanup mutation testing asks for. Filed as
  f-20260829-15; this decision is the local workaround, not the fix.
* **Decided by:** Claude Code, autonomously while Felix was away, under his standing instruction to
  proceed — flagged in the report for him to reverse if he disagrees · **Superseded-by:** -
