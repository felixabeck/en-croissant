# push (Codex bridge)

Read `.claude/skills/push/SKILL.md` first and follow that canonical ChessFable workflow.
Read `~/.claude/references/push-review-policy.md` before its first step.

Follow the canonical execution order and stage-emission contract above.

* Use `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="Codex"` for every commit; leave the author untouched and add no
  co-author trailer.
