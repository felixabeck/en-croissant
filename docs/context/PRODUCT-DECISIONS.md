# Product decisions

This record holds product precedent: what ChessFable is for and how it behaves.
Technical precedent lives in `tasks/decisions.md`. `/decide` writes product decisions
here per `~/.claude/skills/decide/SKILL.md` section 4.

Use one entry per decision, with the question, choice, Felix's reason in his terms,

## 2026-10-04 — One Library with linked collections

- **Question:** Should games and opening material live in one Library instead of
  separate Files and Databases pages organised by storage format?
- **Choice:** One Library, in two phases.
  - **Phase 1:** One Library sidebar entry replaces Files and Databases, with one
    searchable list of files and databases, type badges and a detail pane by item
    type. `/files` and `/databases` redirect to the Library.
  - **Phase 2:** Every collection exists exactly once. A user's own PGN file in the
    library folder is the truth. A database is either the search index of such a
    file or a standalone reference collection.
    - Game collections in the library folder get automatically maintained linked
      search indexes, including after external rewrites. Edits go to the file.
    - Repertoires and studies remain plain files without indexes. Position search
      inside repertoire variations is not promised.
    - Account sync appends only games not already present to one accumulated PGN
      per account in the library folder, linked like any game collection.
    - Large collections imported from outside the library folder remain
      standalone databases.
    - Existing unlinked file/database pairs are offered a one-time link, without
      silent merging or losing edits made on either side since import.
    - Working editing must be preserved. Linked collections ship where PGN
      write-back works (Linux, macOS). Windows keeps unlinked databases until PGN
      atomic replacement is ported.
- **Ruled out:** Converting everything to one storage format. Converting
  repertoires to databases loses free-form editing and repertoire practice.
  Converting databases to PGN loses indexed position search and the opening
  explorer over large collections.
- **Felix's reason:** "in chess space this is all in one list". Users organise by
  purpose, not storage format.
- **Findings:** `f-20261001-11` (phase 1), `f-20261004-15` (phase 2, linked collections).
- **Date:** 2026-10-04.
